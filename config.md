# User Configuration

User configuration is loaded from `config.json` on the device. The following fields are supported:

## `apir_d_threshold`

Displacement threshold for triggering the Analog PIR sensors. Default: `0.3`

## `apir_dt_threshold`

Gradient threshold for triggering the Analog PIR sensors. Default: `450`

## `max_current`

Max current in mA for the spool reset motor. Default: `1000`

## `spool_reset_delay_minutes`

After the spool has triggered it will wait this long before resetting. Default: `10`

## `latitude` / `longitude`

Position used for day and night calculations. Default: `-43.532055` / `172.636230`

## `test_loop_interval`

Loop interval in minutes. On program 9 this is how often it will loop the program. Default: `180`

## `switch_1_disable` / `switch_2_disable`

Disables the trap from triggering when a switch is in a given state. Must be one of `"IGNORE"`, `"OPEN"`, or `"CLOSED"`. Default: `"IGNORE"`

## `switch_logic`

Must be one of `"AND"` or `"OR"`. If `"OR"` then the trap will be disabled if either switch wants to disable it. If `"AND"` then both switches must want to disable it. Default: `"OR"`

**Example:** To disable the trap when a holding cage door is closed (using a reed switch that is `CLOSED` when next to a magnet): set the relevant switch to `"OPEN"`, the other to `"IGNORE"`, and `switch_logic` to `"OR"`. When the cage door closes, the switch goes from `CLOSED` to `OPEN` and the trap is disabled until the door opens again.

## `observation_mode`

In Observation Mode the trap resets at boot but does not trigger. If in a mode that reports events, it will send a `"dry-trigger"` event instead of `"triggered"`. Useful for testing AI trigger accuracy without disturbing animals. Default: `false`

## `motion_message_gap`

Minimum time in seconds between motion messages sent over UART. Default: `10`

## `post_reset_cooldown_seconds`

Seconds to wait after the spool resets before running trap checks. The reset motion can sometimes trigger motion sensors, so this delay avoids false triggers. Default: `20`

## `spool_reed_check`

Set to `true` if a reed sensor is wired up to detect when the spool is in the reset position. Default: `false`

## `program`

If the program select swithc is set to 0, the trap will instead run this program.
